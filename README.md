All of the server admins have the @Mythical Royalty role, those are the ones you report to. If a staff member is sexually harassing a member, report the staff member to owner Aleks directly, they are the one with the @Higher Moon role. 

:heavy_check_mark: 8: Spam? NO SPAM. This rule is for all channels. Keep tagging at a minimal, don’t excessively ping staff or other members.

:heavy_check_mark: 10: Don't beg for roles. Moderators are decided by the admins, staff apps will be avaiable in waves and won't be given out. Your chances of recieving a staff rank lower when you ask for it, so don't ask. The roles you can have are the self-assignable roles listed below. 

:heavy_check_mark: 11: No hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive will not be tolerated

:heavy_check_mark: 12: If a staff member asks you to stop something, you should stop. Don't make a scene in the chats and argue with the staff about the situation.
