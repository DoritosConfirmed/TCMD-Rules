:heavy_check_mark: 7: Report staff to an admin if you notice them abusing their rights, treating members poorly, or behaving in a way that may need to be looked further into. All of the server admins have the @Mythical Royalty role, those are the ones you report to. If a staff member is sexually harassing a member, report the staff member to owner Aleks directly, they are the one with the @Higher Moon role. 

:heavy_check_mark: 8: Spam? NO SPAM. This rule is for all channels. Keep tagging at a minimal, don’t excessively ping staff or other members. Don't use spammy nicknames, if a staff feels your nickname is spammy, they have the freedom to change it. [Playing in the Bots channel isn't considered as spamming]

:heavy_check_mark: 9: Self-promoting stays in #promotion. If it's found elsewhere you'll recieve a warning and the promotion will be deleted. 

:heavy_check_mark: 10: Don't beg for roles. Moderators are decided by the admins, staff apps will be avaiable in waves and won't be given out. Your chances of recieving a staff rank lower when you ask for it, so don't ask. The roles you can have are the self-assignable roles listed below. 

:heavy_check_mark: 11: No hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive will not be tolerated

:heavy_check_mark: 12: If a staff member asks you to stop something, you should stop. Don't make a scene in the chats and argue with the staff about the situation. If you feel as you were wrongly muted/warned/banned, take it up with the admins and they will look into the situation. Drink some tea and calm down, don't start a war with people out of anger. 

:heavy_check_mark: 13: The server is an inclusive safe space for all. However, we are not professionals. We cannot assist you during suicidal episodes or any intense behavioural/mental stress.

☆#queer-town-square - Just like tavern, but this channel is for those in the LGBTQ+ community. *Requires the @LGBTQ+ role to access* 

☆red-light-district - This is where any NSFW R18 content can be, however the mature content that can be posted have to go along with the server guidelines. **No full human nudity, porn, sexual gore images, implied rape/force RP, or any intense material that may trigger PTSD.** (This is for images and videos) Lewd images, sexual memes, cropped porn memes, or sexual implicating, etc CAN be posted here. *Requires the @NSFW role to access*

☆#crisis-corner - The server staff want a safe space for everyone, meaning if you're having a bad time or something has happened, please use this space to vent or get it out of your system.

Talking of rape/sexual assault expieriences or PTSD triggering events can be discussed here, but we ask you to use the Discord's spoiler tag function including a TW/CW. It hides the content for those who may not be able to handle randomly reading it, but still allows you to talk of it if needed.    **For example: TW/CW: Rape ||your vent here||**

☆#queer-venting - Much like the Crisis Corner, this is for those with the LGBTQ+ role to vent about some of the heavier topics that other LGBTQ+ members would understand most.
