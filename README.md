# Server Rules: 
Welcome to Tabletop Chaos &amp; Mysterious Disaster Official Server Rules

2: Full nudity, porn, sexual gore images, rape, obscene intense material is not allowed to be posted within the server, the NSFW channel is no exception to this. Read more about what can be posted in the NSFW channel further down. 

3: Keep the server a friendly place. Respect the members and staff in the server. There will be zero tolerance for those who bully others. The server is made up of individuals from different cultures, ethnicites, sexual orientations, genders, and races; the staff will not put up with those using these different qualities in people to bully others. 

4: The server is consider R-17, swearing is allowed minimmaly. We don't want exccessive swearing all over the place.

5: Talking of rape or sexual assault outside of the appropriate channel is not allowed. You can read more about this in the channels section. 

6: Keep content relevant in the appropriate channels. 

7: Report staff to an admin if you notice them abusing their rights, treating members poorly, or behaving in a way that may need to be looked further into. All of the server admins have the @Mythical Royalty role, those are the ones you report to. If a staff member is sexually harassing a member, report the staff member to owner Aleks directly, they are the one with the @Higher Moon role. 

8: Spam? NO SPAM. This rule is for all channels. Keep tagging at a minimal, donâ€™t excessively ping staff or other members. Don't use spammy nicknames, if a staff feels your nickname is spammy, they have the freedom to change it. [Playing in the Bots channel isn't considered as spamming]

9: Self-promoting stays in #promotion. If it's found elsewhere you'll recieve a warning and the promotion will be deleted. 

10: Don't beg for roles. Moderators are decided by the admins, staff apps will be avaiable in waves and won't be given out. Your chances of recieving a staff rank lower when you ask for it, so don't ask. The roles you can have are the self-assignable roles listed below. 

11: No hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive will not be tolerated

12: If a staff member asks you to stop something, you should stop. Don't make a scene in the chats and argue with the staff about the situation. If you feel as you were wrongly muted/warned/banned, take it up with the admins and they will look into the situation. Drink some tea and calm down, don't start a war with people out of anger.
